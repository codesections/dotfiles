        Since then, I've built projects ◊Link{in JavaScript[1]},
        ◊Link{in Rust[2]}, and in ◊Link{whatever other[3]} languages seemed
        ◊Link{best for the job[4]}.  I´m a firm believer in the power of free
        and open-source software and have contributed to ◊Link{dozens of
        open-source projects[5]}.  I´ve been particularly involved in the Rust
        ecosystem, and serve on the Rust ◊Link{Command Line Application working
        group[6]}.}
